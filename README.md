# TPSM
Extremely advanced batchfile program that is designed to be a smart chatbot with RP support. 

How to use?

TPSM will be scheduled to have pretrained premade releases for all operating systems. You can check on the releases tab. Otherwise, Run "TPSM.bat"

you can type:

git clone https://github.com/dgrtygry/TPSM.git
cd TPSM

if on android, run "tpsm-install" this should automatically install to android. I wouldn't recommend though as Android is not officially supported on TPSM. maybe soon though!
